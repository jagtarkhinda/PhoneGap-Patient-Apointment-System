# PhoneGap Patient Appointment System
This repo contains source code for application created using PhoneGap(Cordova). It is a management system where people can register appointment for clinic and get notifications.

- **Note: As this is a cordova project, it can be compiled for browser use, but I designed the interface for mobile so it will not feel the same and also the notification, toast and some warnings will not work on browser.**

#### Check out the working project [here](http://jagtar.xyz/Cordova/)

**Technologies used** - HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQLite, HTML5 Local Storage and this [plugin for notifications](https://github.com/katzer/cordova-plugin-local-notifications)
### Below is the summary of tasks I performed in this project

Develop an application for patients in a clinic using PhoneGap.
